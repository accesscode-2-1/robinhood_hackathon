1. Effective and Engaging Demo + Presentation  
2. Solves a relevant problem in NYC  
3. Originality - is the hack more than a generic mobile app? Does it take a novel approach or solve a new problem?  
4. Polish - Is the hack usable in its current state? Is the user experience smooth? Does everything appear to work? Is it well designed?  
5. Technical Difficulty - Is the hack technically interesting or difficult?
